# Exploring Watson Discovery
====================================

This project is intended to be used to walk through the Watson Discovery Service and explore other Watson Services at to support developer engagement IBM clients. Because this is a public repo, it contains no client specific information. 


## Watson Services Guide for Developers

The [Watson Services Guide for Developers](WatsonServicesGuideForDevelopersV2.0.pdf) is a summary to introduce the Watson API's. It contains links to relevant information and resources and has a one page summary of each Watson API.


## Exercise Walk Throughs

These are the instructions and all supporting files for the walk through exercises.

The hands on lab exercises are:

### Walkthrough 1 - Watson Discovery - Structured and Unstructured
In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with the Watson Discovery service tooling by importing data and using the tooling to setup the service, import data and explore simple and advanced queries as well as adding custom enrichments and using the Watson Explorer to review the call invocation and the data returned.

### Lab 3 - Watson NLU and Watson Tone Analyzer
In this lab you'll use a combination of Watson Tone Analyzer and Watson NLU to identify highlights of the  transcripts of an earnings call. The presenters of earnings call typically try to make the calls as positive  as possible so using Tone Analyzer to find the statements  that have the highest score for joy is a good way to screen the  transcript for the most positive highlights. Once you have these sentences identified you run them through NLU to get the most relevant keywords to identify the topics covered in each  positive statement. 

#### 3.1 Clone the following git repository to your local system.

#### 3.2 Follow the instructions in the repo's [README.md](https://github.com/djccarew/watson-toneanalyzer-nlu-lab) file to complete the lab.


### Lab 4 - Watson Visual Recognition
Use the Watson Visual Recognition service to train and test a classifier that can recognize wedding pictures. This could be used to analyze social media to identify customers that may respond to certian offers that are better suited to married couples. 


#### 4.1 Clone the following git repository to your local system.
[https://github.com/djccarew/watson-vr-custom-classifer-lab.git](https://github.com/djccarew/watson-vr-custom-classifer-lab.git)

#### 4.2 Follow the instructions in the repo's [README.md](https://github.com/djccarew/watson-vr-custom-classifer-lab) file to complete the lab.


### Lab 5 - Watson Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation)
